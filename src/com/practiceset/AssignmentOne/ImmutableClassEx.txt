// Ques - Make a following class immutable

             class Employee {
                int id;
                String name;
                List<String> addresses;
            }


//Solution - Immutable class in java means that once an object is created, we cannot change its content.

          1. The class must be declared as final so that child classes can’t be created.
          2. Data members in the class must be declared private so that direct access is not allowed.
          3. Data members in the class must be declared as final so that we can’t change the value of it after object creation.

            final class Employee{
            private int id;
            private String name;
            private List<String> addresses;
            }
